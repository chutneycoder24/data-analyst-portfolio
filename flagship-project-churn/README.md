ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Telecommunication companies face significant revenue loss from customer churn. This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset to:

Predict customer churn.

Identify the main factors driving attrition.

Provide business recommendations to improve retention.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Methods

Data Cleaning & Wrangling: Python (pandas, numpy)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): matplotlib, seaborn

Modeling: CART (Classification and Regression Tree), Logistic Regression

Visualization: Tableau / Power BI (dashboards), static PNGs

ðŸ“Š Key Steps

Data Preparation

Cleaned missing values in TotalCharges.

Encoded categorical variables.

Balanced dataset (churn â‰ˆ 26%).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Month-to-month customers had the highest churn (~43%).

High monthly charges strongly correlated with churn.

Tenure under 1 year was the riskiest group.

Modeling

CART: ~82% accuracy. Provided clear business rules.

Logistic Regression: ~80% accuracy. Confirmed variable significance.

ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights

Top Predictors of Churn:

Contract type (month-to-month most at risk).

Monthly charges (higher bills â†’ higher churn).

Customer tenure (shorter tenure â†’ higher churn).

Business Recommendations:

Promote 1â€“2 year contracts with discounts.

Launch retention campaigns for short-tenure, high-charge customers.

Offer bundles/loyalty perks to reduce bill shock.
