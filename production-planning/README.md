# üõ†Ô∏è Production Planning Optimization (Excel Solver)

**Goal:** Build an optimization model to maximize profit (or minimize cost) subject to capacity and demand constraints.

## What‚Äôs Inside
- `excel-models/` ‚Üí Excel file using Simplex Solver
- `data/` ‚Üí input parameters (costs, capacities, demands)
- `reports/` ‚Üí short write-up on assumptions and results

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel workbook in `excel-models/`.
2. Update parameters in the input sheet.
3. Use **Data ‚Üí Solver** to re-run the optimization.
4. Review the optimal plan in the output sheet.

## Notes
- Great example of operations research in Excel.
- Consider adding sensitivity analysis (vary capacity or demand).
