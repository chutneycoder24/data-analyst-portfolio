# ✅ Quality Control Predictive Modeling

**Goal:** Predict defects or failures in a manufacturing context.

## What’s Inside
- `notebooks/` → EDA + model training
- `data/` → raw/cleaned data
- `visuals/` → confusion matrix, ROC curve
- `reports/` → recommendations for QA process

## Suggested Models
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost
- Evaluate with precision/recall, F1, ROC AUC

## Business Impact
- Prioritize inspections on high-risk items.
- Reduce scrap/rework costs.
